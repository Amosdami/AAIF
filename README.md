## Langchain Agent for Natural Language Queries (Northwind & APIs)
This project implements a Python-based Langchain agent designed to handle natural language queries. It can interact with both a local database (Northwind) and external APIs.

# Key Features:

Database Interaction: Executes user queries on the Northwind SQLite database (provided separately).
API Integration: Makes calls to a public API endpoint (example provided, but replaceable).
Natural Language Processing (Basic): Uses a simple intent classification mechanism to identify the user's intent (database vs. API).
FAST API Integration: Exposes an endpoint for handling natural language queries sent through tools like Postman.
How to Use:

# 1. Prerequisites:

Python 3.x with pip installed.
Download the Northwind SQLite database (northwind.db) from [link to Northwind database download ON GitHub github.com] and place it in the same directory as this Python file (langchain_agent.py).
# 2. Installation:

Open a command prompt or terminal in the project directory and run:

`pip install langchain sqlite3 fastapi uvicorn requests`

# 3. Running the Agent:

`uvicorn langchain_agent:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`

This starts the FAST API server, listening on port 8000.

# 4. Interaction with Postman:

Open Postman and create a POST request to http://localhost:8000/query.
In the body, enter your natural language query (e.g., "What are the products in Northwind?" or "Call the RESTful API to get quotes").
Send the request.
The response will contain the results from the database query, API call, or an error message if the intent is not recognized.
Bonus - Langchain Integration (Advanced):

This version uses a basic intent classification approach. For more sophisticated natural language processing, consider integrating a complete Langchain model like spaCy or Rasa.

Deployment (Optional):

While deployment instructions are not provided due to URL limitations, you can explore platforms like Render.com or Vercel.com to deploy your Langchain agent as a web service.
